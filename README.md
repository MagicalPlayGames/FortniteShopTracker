# FortniteShopTracker
 This app is a web content aggregator using fortnite-api.com
 This app tracks Fortnite Item Shop items and Fortnite Stats

Swipe left to access the item shop, and tap the tabs at the top to organize by category

Swipe right to access the stats. Enter your Fortnite gamer tag for xbox, playstation, or epic accounts

The Fortnite Tracker uses fortnite-api.com so there are the following limitations:
You cannot see trios stats because it is always equal to None on fortnite-api.com
If you load the app without internet, a prompt will tell you to reload the app, and will not display anything else.
Wifi is needed to use this app.
To load the app, download the APK and load it on an Android 10+ device.
You can also download the project, and make sure kivy, and kivyMD are installed in your IDE
